# Weather-App
Basic Weather App which functionality consists of querying weather forecast for a week and displaying it day by day. Also has a detailed view for each day.

## Installation instructions
git clone and add an apiKey in /Services/WeatherProvider (you can get if for free at openweathermap.org)

## About
The goal of this app is mainly to learn how to write clean, concise, maintainable and scalable code (so UI is kind of lacking).

Patterns used: MVVM, Coordinator, Factory.

UI is made programmatically.

List of available places for weather forecast preloaded in CoreData container on the first launch.
